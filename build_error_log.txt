EAS Build Error - Install pods phase failed

Build ID: b259bb9b-511a-49a4-bda5-65dac64454e6
Build #: 2 (1.0.0)
Git ref: 79f7be7

Error message:
"Build failed: Unknown error. See logs of the Install pods build phase for more information."

The error occurred during the "Install pods" step which took 5 seconds.

This is consistent with the Folly coroutine header error we've been encountering.
The build is using EAS Build cloud infrastructure which appears to be using Xcode 16/26 beta
that has the incompatibility with React Native's Folly library.

Key observation:
- Even though we specified macos-sonoma-14.5-xcode-15.4 in eas.json for GitHub Actions,
  the EAS Build cloud service itself (triggered by GitHub Actions) is using its own
  infrastructure which may be running Xcode 16/26.

The GitHub Actions workflow successfully submitted the build to EAS, but EAS Build's
own infrastructure is where the actual compilation happens, and that's where it's failing.
